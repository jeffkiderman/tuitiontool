// should only flow one way, so when I say 'send updates up', i just mean calling
// the function that was passed into this component -- which conveniently affect
// state in the TuitionToolRoot.  Were we only to modify state in this component,
// TuitionToolRoot would not be able to read it or react to it.

      // what it does is take kidData and unwraps it as key-value attributes
      // passed to the Kid.

      // unpack those to be name="jeff" grade="4", which is a convenient way
      // to turn data/objects into props :)
